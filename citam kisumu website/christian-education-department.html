					<h3>CITAM KISUMU CHURCH CHRISTIAN EDUCATION DEPARTMENT DETAILS-2014.</h3>
					
					<h4>Christian Education aims at causing a positive impact in the church by:-</h4>
					<p>Assisting Christians, to commit themselves to Christ, and grow to maturity in Him.</p>
					
					<h3>Some of the programs that fall under CED include: </h3>
					<p>1. Bible exposition hour: This is a time set aside every Sunday from 9:30-10:30am, for members to be grounded in the word of God. </p>
					<p>2. Classes 101-401: Are aimed at inducting Christians into church membership and training them to maturity in Christ.  </p>
					<p>3. New Believers class: This is a class designed to help the new believers grow in their faith in the Lord- also known as ‘follow up class’. During this time, new believers can begin to grow into maturity and learn to become multiplying disciples. They are taught how to pray, read the Word of God as a practice, build a loving relationship with the Lord Jesus, fellowship with other believers, encourage them to witness to others about Christ, and finally help them understand who the Holy Spirit is and importance of being Baptized in the Holy Spirit.  </p>
					<p>4. Doctrinal Class: This is an avenue for new believers to be taught the doctrines of the Christian faith. The classes are on every Sunday at the multi purpose hall 8:30-9:30am.</p>
					<p>5. Baptism: It is an act of faith which involves a physical demonstration of a believer dying to self and becoming living in Christ.  </p>
					<p>6. Ministry fair: This is an event that gives members of various ministries in the church an opportunity to market their ministries by informing the entire congregants what transpires in the various ministries.</p>
					<p>7. Impact zone track classes: This programmajors on utilizing the great wealth of gifts amongst members of our congregation. It aims at doing church innovatively by involving the members in the facilitation of the sessions, tackling important issues in our lives and society e.g. family life issues, leadership issues among other</p>
					<p>8. Family fun Day: Its an event organized annually by this department where families and all members in church come together, for a whole day, to have fun, fellowship, share a meal and pray together. It is an avenue for members to bond some more.  </p>
					<p>9. Home Bible study Fellowships.: This is a ministry committed to ensuring that members of the church are well grounded in scriptures. Believers meet weekly on Tuesdays- 5:30-7:00pm, for fellowship in members’ homes. The sessions are organized, participatory and very interactive</p>
					
					<h3>Vision:</h3>
					<p>To minister to the entire person (believer) - Spirit, soul and body. Acts 2:42… devoted…to teaching and to fellowship… to the breaking of bread and to prayer. </p>
					
					<h3>Mission. </h3>
					<p>To raise true members of the body of Christ who are well discipled in the word of God.  </p>
					
					<h3>ACTIVITIES </h3>
					<p>Fellowship and care:<br>
The Bible study groups are avenues for members to interact with one another, sharing experiences, edifying one another in the word. Members also confess their sins to one another bearing each others’ burdens and supporting each other in times of need.
</p>
					
					
					<p>Mentoring:<br>
Bible study sessions provide an opportunity for mentoring young and new believers to help them develop strong spiritual muscles, thereby becoming strong in their Christian walk.
</p>
					
					
					
					<p>Social support:<br>
Members of B/s stand with one another in giving social and moral support to one another through participating in weddings, graduations, funerals, sicknesses and celebrating the arrival of newborns among others.
