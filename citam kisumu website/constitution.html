</p>
					
					<h4>6.0 Motto</h4>
					<p>Christ Is The Answer.</p>
					
					<h4>7.0 Statement of Faith</h4>
					<p>The Church believes that Jesus Christ is the Answer to all human problems and undertakes to fulfill her divine mandate of making disciples of all Nations according to Colossians 1:28-29 and Mathew 28:18-20.<br>
7.1 We believe in the one eternal God who exists in the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, the Creator and Lord of the world, who governs all things according to the purpose of His will, calling out of the world a people for Himself and sending them back into the world to be His servants and witnesses for the extension of His Kingdom, the building of Christ’s church to the glory of His name.<br>
7.2 We believe in the one Saviour, Jesus Christ Himself being the only God-man, who died for the sins of mankind and was raised from the dead according to the scriptures; the only ransom for sinners and mediator between God and man; who is exalted above every other name as Saviour of the world; who offers forgiveness of sins and the liberating gift of the Spirit to all who repent, believe and come to him personally; and those who reject Him, by so doing, also reject the joy of salvation and condemn themselves to eternal separation from God.<br>
7.3 We believe in God the Holy Spirit who bears witness to Jesus Christ, and whose power works among men to lead to the conviction of sin, faith in Christ, new birth and Christian growth; and speaking through Scriptures illumines the minds of God’s people in every culture to perceive the truth and disclose to the whole church of the wisdom of God;
7.4 We believe in the divine inspiration, truthfulness and authority of the sixty six books of the Old and New Testament Scriptures as the infallible Word of God with power to accomplish His purpose of salvation;<br>
7.5 We believe in the return of Jesus Christ personally and visibly in power and glory to consummate His salvation and judgment; the interim period being filled with evangelism by the people of God, who eagerly await for Christ’s return, the coming of the new heaven and new earth in which righteousness will dwell and God will reign forever.<br>
7.6 We believe in water baptism by immersion of believers as a public declaration of a believer’s identity with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection; and as a public declaration of the initiation into the body of Christ-the Church (Romans 6:3-4).<br>
7.7 We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4).6<br>
</p>
					
					<h4>8.0 Core Values</h4>
					<p>The Church is committed to nurturing the following core values:<br>
8.1 Family: We are committed to building strong and effective families that serve the purposes that God ordained for them. We believe that the family constitutes a union between a man and a woman who are united in marriage, and their offspring.<br>
8.2 Ministry: We are committed to living, preaching and teaching the word of God. Our love for God and His calling shall be our driving force. The power and influence of the Holy Spirit is the key agent of transformation. We value, appreciate and recognize the diversity of gifts in the body of Christ.<br>
8.3 The Sanctity of Life: We uphold and respect the sanctity of life from conception to natural death.<br>
8.4 Partnership: We are committed to partnering with like-minded ministries, churches, Para-church organizations and other agencies that subscribe to our philosophy of ministry.<br>
8.5 Excellence: In keeping with our identity and ministry target, we are committed to a culture of excellence in all our services and ministries.<br>
8.6 Community: We exist and work in a community. We believe that it is our responsibility to impact them in a holistic manner. We stand in solidarity with those who are vulnerable within our society.<br>
8.7 Integrity: We are committed to personal integrity and holiness. We are committed to teaching and practicing sound biblical doctrine<br>
8.8 Accountability: We are committed to a culture of transparency and accountability with our members and the general public.<br>
8.9 Leadership: We are committed to godly transformational leadership in Church and society that equips believers to participate in the Great Commission. People are our greatest asset both within and without the church.<br>
