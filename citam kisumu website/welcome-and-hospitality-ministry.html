					<h3>Patron: Mrs. Rosemary Openda<hr></h3>
					
					<h4>Head of Department: Mrs. May Munambo</h4>
					
					
					<h3>Introduction  </h3>
					<p>One of the greatest valuable earthly possessions a person can have is a warm and supportive friendship. Life is all about relationships. People without relationships are miserable and are deprived of life essential handle. Relationships cannot be purchased. They arise from our innermost needs, grounded in our God-given ability to love and care for others. A growing, healthy church nurtures both vertical and horizontal healthy relationships.
</p>
					
					<h4>Serving in Hospitality/Welcome Ministry (HWM) is a calling;-<hr></h4>
					<p>To make church visitors feel so welcome that they want to come back, and if residents of Kisumu, make their search for a church to worship in, come to an end, and to a member, to freely do exploits in the Kingdom of God through various ministries with a sense of ownership.<br>
In hospitality, we also minister to Pastors by providing refreshments and making sure they serve/minister in a conducive environment.
</p>
					
					<h4>Vision<hr></h4>
					<p>The Hospitality Ministry seeks to provide a welcoming environment for visitors, members and friends. After each Sunday services we share refreshment with pastors and visitors. As Christ invited his loved ones to share His table, we share ours too.</p>
					
					<h4>Mission<hr></h4>
					<p>The Hospitality/Welcome Ministry has become firmly established as a ministry at Kisumu Pentecostal Church and it is our goal to encourage everyone to exhibit a welcoming attitude to all who come for fellowship whether guest or members. We always look for new ways to create a gracious atmosphere for our guests and members by offering them a sense of warmth, belonging and a deep spirit of joy and making them feel part of us and of the body of Christ.
</p>
					
					<h3>OBJECTIVES<hr></h3>
					<p>† Following up with visitors after every church service. It often adds a quality of care that completes the quieter time of the preceding sermon.<br>
† Hospitality team holds open doors and shares a parting word of blessing that sets a tone of invitation for future visits and increased participation.<br>
† Learning about the facility and drawing on a person's natural warmth to connect with others are facets of training for a hospitality team.<br.
† Orientation to our guests/visitors on our Belief, Mission and Vision

</p>
					
					<h4>Service/Ministry<hr></h4>
					<p>Goal(s): For the youths to discover their unique gifts, skills and abilities and nurturing them to glorify God.
We have the various church service ministries in which we encourage our youths to participate, e.g., Praise & Worship, drama, dance, hospitality, missions, e.t.c.
</p>
					
					<h3>How often will I be expected to set up hospitality?</h3>
					
					
					
					
					<p>We currently have a four-team rotation, so we each are scheduled only once a month. The more people we can get involved or join the ministry, the longer the time will be that you will be scheduled to provide hospitality. </p>
					
					<h3>When do I get paid?</h3>
					<p>Payment comes in the form of;<br>
† All the smiles and sense of belonging we see on the faces of our visitors as we engage in fellowship and as we share and serve refreshments.<br>
† The joy to see people we fellowshipped with as visitors joining Class 101 and becoming members and more so being actively involved in ministries in church.
 </p>
