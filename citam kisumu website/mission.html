					<h3>VISION</h3>
					<p>Kenya and the rest of the world impacted with the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
					<h3>MISSION</h3>
					<p>To know God and make Him known through evangelism and discipleship</p>
					
					<h3>OUR IDENTITY</h3>
					<p>We are a Pentecostal Church submitted totally to the Blessed Holy Spirit</p>
					<p>We are an English speaking Church with a target audience among the urban populace.</p>
					<p>We are missions oriented, with an outreach to the wider community within their context.</p>
					<p>We are a community of believers, open to people of all tribes, races and social-strata of the community.</p>
					<p>We are a Church with a Ministry approach that is holistic. We seek to reach out to the whole person with the life changing Gospel.</p>

					<h3>STATEMENT OF FAITH</h3>
					<p>We believe in the one eternal God and in the Trinity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the Creator and Lord of the world, who governs all things according to the purpose of His will, calling out of the world a people for himself and sending them back into the world to be His servants and witnesses for the extension of His Kingdom, the building of Christ's church to the glory of His name.</p>
					<p>We believe in the one Saviour, Jesus Christ Himself being the only God-man, who died for the sins of mankind and was raised from the dead according to the scriptures; the only ransom for sinners and mediator between God and man; who is exalted above every other name as Saviour of the world; who offers forgiveness of sins and the liberating gift of the Spirit to all who repent, believe and come to him personally; and those who reject Him, by so doing, also reject the joy of salvation and condemn themselves to eternal separation from God.</p>
					<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, sent by God the Father to bear witness to his Son, whose power and works among men lead to the conviction of sin, faith in Christ, new birth and Christian growth; and speaking through Scriptures illumines the minds of God's people in every culture to perceive the truth and disclose to the whole church of the wisdom of God.</p>
					<p>We believe in the divine inspiration, truthfulness and authority of the Old and New Testament Scriptures as the infallible Word of God with power to accomplish His purpose of salvation.</p>
					<p>We believe in the return of Jesus Christ personally and visibly in power and glory to consummate His salvation and judgment; the interim period being filled with evangelism by the people of God, who eagerly await for Christ's return, the coming of the new heaven and new earth in which righteousness will dwell and God will reign forever.</p>


					<h3>CORE VALUES</h3>
					<p>CITAM is committed to nurturing in its assemblies, ministries and programs these key values:</p>
					<p>Ministry: We are committed to living, preaching and teaching the word of God. Our love for God and His calling shall be our driving force. The power and influence of the Holy Spirit is the key agent of transformation. We value, appreciate and recognize the diversity of gifts in the body of Christ.</p>
					<p>Leadership: We are committed to godly transformational leadership in Church and society that equips believers to participate in the Great Commission. People are our greatest asset both within and without the church.</p>
					<p>Community: We work with and exist in a community. We believe that it is our responsibility to impact them in a holistic manner. We will stand in solidarity with those who are marginalized by society.</p>
					<p>Family: - We are committed to building strong and effective families that serve the purpose that God ordained for them. We believe that the family constitutes a union between a man and a woman and their offspring.</p>
					<p>Integrity: We are committed to personal integrity and holiness in the ministry. We are committed to teaching and practicing sound Biblical doctrine.</p>
					<p>Accountability: We are committed to a culture of transparency and accountability with our members and the general public</p>

					<p>The Sanctity of Life: We uphold and respect the sanctity of life from conception.</p>
					<p>Partnership: We are committed to partnering with like-minded ministries, churches, Para- church organizations and other agencies that subscribe to our philosophy of ministry.</p>
