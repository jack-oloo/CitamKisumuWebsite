							<h4>Rev Martin Mbandu</h4>
							<p>Born on 15th November, 1956 to a Christian couple in the lbona village, East Bunyore in the current Vihiga District. The fourth born child in a family of 8. Attended early primary school in Vihiga before moving to Nairobi. My folks resided in Eastland’s of Nairobi, Mbotela Estate.  My parents and specifically my mother were staunch members of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God (P.A.G.) Bahati.They participated in various leadership roles at the church this was during the 70’s and into 80s. During this time l was constant attendant of church because l loved hanging on my mother’s skirt, so that wherever she went on church errands and ministry, l tagged along. I had just done my CPE exams in 1972 when l met the Rev. Cornelius family through my mom. These were missionaries from the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada who frequented the local Bahati church and most times preached there.  This couple got so close to me and was interested in my curiosity of knowing the word of God. They requested my parents if they could adopt me every weekend to spend time at their home in Kilimani, attend church with them in Valley Road, and then be back in Eastland’s Sunday night for school on Monday. My parents were delighted and quickly accepted before the Mzungus could change their mind.</p>
							<p>Thus l was introduced to NPC-Valley  Rd. by the Cornellius family, and there l was handed over to Pastor Mervyn Thomas who took me in dearly. There at NPC ;I met other young people who were on fire for the Lord and an active Sunday school going on. l was determined to learn as much as l could about God. In 1972 at the age of 15yrs l joined a Sunday school class being taught by (now) Elder Albert  Okinda. Later on as l grew with the Cornellius family and with the Thomas family my spiritual life grew deeper that l even contemplated going to Bible College but dismissed the idea. Meanwhile l had cleared my secondary school and gotten a job with a certain Asian(Rajinder  Singh) exporting fresh produce to Britain(Horticultural). The company closed down in 1976,the same year l joined the East  African  Posts & Telecommunication in postal department as a postal officer. They sent me to their training college for a period of six months before l was deployed at the GPO as a postal officer(clerk). From here in Dec. 1976 by the grace of God l rose to the rank of Postal Supt. In 1988 is when l received a strong conviction to serve Jesus on full time basis. Thus after many prayers and soul searching l gave my life to the complete service of Christ and enrolled with the Pan Africa  Christian  College (Now PACU). Where l did the four years degree course in Bible and Theology. Graduating in 1993 July and was invited to join the Nairobi  Pentecostal  Church as  a minister. </p>
							
							<h3>SALVATION AND MARRIAGE.</h3>
							<p>After tugging on my mother’s skirt for too long and having gotten saved many times as a kid without understanding salvation, l committedly gave my life to Jesus and asked Him to come into my life and soul in 1973 May at the Nairobi PentecostalChurch at the age of 16yrs old, under the ministry of Pastor Mervyn Thomas. Was baptized by Immersion by the same pastor, the same year and thus changed my name from Kwendo  Mbandu to Martin Mbandu. Previously l had been very religious in our beloved denomination(PAG) not until salvation was clearly explained to me. Ever since l have walked with Lord in faithfulness and prayer determined to live a pure life, pleasing to Him and serving Him. While at NPC l served in various ministries of the church as a youth. Sung in the church choir, was one of the youth leaders in the Youth Fellowship, we went to church camps, participated in the Men’s Fellowship and in the Evangelism department of the church. It was while serving and being involve in ministry at NPC that l met my beautiful light skinned shy wife Rachael in December of 1984.(I was to take the youths to a Youth Camp at Goibei near Kisumu and thus we sat together for all those hours to Kisumu) We got married in 1985 August 17th after a time of really convincing her father that we were serious and that l would love Rachael to death. We are blessed with four children;  Mervyn(26),  Sheldon(23)  Catherine(20) and Sarah(8). The Lord has been good to us. </p>
							
							<h3>CALLING AND MINISTRY.</h3>
							<p>After serving in various areas of the church in ministries which l enjoyed tremendously especially singing in the choir and the Men’s Fellowship,  Young Adult Fellowship (VCCF) under the mentorship of the late Dr. Tokumboh, l started having some unusual nudging to get in the full time ministry. Though l often would dismiss the feelings or prompting of the Holy Spirit which l was well aware was working on me.  My pastor Rev. D. White at one time counseled me to see if it was true that l was running away from God’s call on my life. I tried to brush it off when confronted with certain prophesies from brethren, until one day at my place of work when there was a rumour that promotion was coming my way that l heard a still small voice speaking from Mark  8:36.”What shall it profit you to gain the whole world and loose your soul?” Thus l surrendered my life to the full time service of God. This was in May 1989 and the same year in June l tendered my resignation (which was rejected by the authorities then but l moved on anyhow) and by September l enrolled with the PACC college for my Theological studies. Thanks to my pastor Dennis White,  and Pastor  Adoyo and Dr. Tokumboh who encouraged me to go for it! My wife stood with me and promised to support me through the studies and ministry (which she has done and still does even today, for she too got her calling, went to Bible College and graduated and is now serving with me in the field).</p>
							<p>I served as a minister for Visitation when l first teamed up with the NPC-pastoral team 1993 November, this was quite fulfilling and satisfying. l also did some evangelism for two years when our church Evangelist went abroad for further studies. Resumed my Visitation ministry in 1998 and the following year responded to the call to plant the church In Kisumu.  My wife and l have labored in Kisumu for ten years from 1999 to 2009 December when we moved to Malawi in April 2010.Currently we are serving as CITAM missionaries seconded to the Pentecostal  Assemblies of Malawi through the partnership of Pentecostal Assemblies of  Canada. We are stationed in Mzuzu north of Malawi, pasturing the Mzuzu Pentecostal Church. We were sent to assist and establish an urban ministry congregation for the PAOM. Originally we were to head for Blantyre but plans changed and now we are serving at Mzuzu church. It’s our prayer that God doesn’t make mistakes in sending us here, and as for us we are available to wherever He sends. We have been in Mzuzu since October 2010 and hope serve in Malawi till 2013 Dec. when our permit expires.</p>
				
							<p>We have seen the hand of the Lord in ministry here, over 500 souls have given their lives to the Lord through the musical concerts by the Men’s Chorale from NPC-Karen. Through the major crusade in June by the NPC-Central Mission team(26) who came for two weeks of Outreach. We also have witnessed many  people respond to the gospel in our church services and the “Jesus  Film” campaign which we have every other Sunday with our youth in church. The church which was almost closing down is now alive and vibrant to the glory of God. The giving which had drastically gone down are now well up and we are able to meet our financial obligations. GLORY IS TO GOD!  We have had opportunity to minister in other cities of Malawi namely:- Blantyre,  Lilongwe and Karonga.  We are in good fellowship with the local leadership of the PAOM(Pentecostal Assemblies of Malawi) We thank God for the CITAM ,FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS MISSIONERS AND FOR THE UNFAILING SUPPORT GIVEN TO US BOTH IN CASH AND KIND. TO GOD BE THE GLORY!!!</p>
