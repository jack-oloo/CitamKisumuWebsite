					<h3>THEME: BEHOLD AN OPEN DOOR</h3>
					
					
					
					
						<p>  Jesus is our best example<br>
when it comes to spending time with God especially in prayer. Someone has said that: If you must compare yourself with someone, compare yourself with Christ. Time alone with God is essential for any serious disciple of our Lord Jesus Christ. The writers of the Gospels in their writings point out that there is something Jesus often did as Luke indicates: Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives... (Luke 22:39a, NIV)<br>
 
Jesus often went to the Mount of Olives alone to spend time with God our Father. Being who He was and yet finding time to do this necessary thing, how much more ought we to do so? It is as we surrender to God in prayer and spending time in His presence that we die to self. It is only then that one can truly say; I have died to self and therefore, it is no longer I but Christ living in me. The cost of following the Lord Jesus, His promises and being a good example of His disciple at home can never be an issue. <br>
 
In the month of October, we call on all of us to make it our lifestyle; spending time with our God in prayer and otherwise. If God is truly our friend, we will not hesitate at all to make the time to be with Him. May Godâ€™s grace be sufficient to you as you do so!
