						<h2>History and Background</h2>
						<p>CITAM KISUMU</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/bishopvisit.JPG" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The church begun in 1988 as a missionary outreach program by the PAOC missionaries based at Nyang’ori Pentecostal Bible College under the leadership of Dr. Winston Brooms. This venture was born out of a desire to have an English-speaking church in Kisumu town. The opening was preceded by a 21-days crusade led by among others; Dr. Winston Brooms, Rev. B. Lihanda and Rev. Mayaka. The church was based at YWCA.</p>
					<p>Dr. Brooms was a robust preacher who took his students out almost every weekend for crusades. When he left, the church came under PAG who were behind his early departure. Pastor Bernard Abongo took over. He later left to take up a teaching position at Kapsengere Secondary School. After him came others who did not do very well and the church continued to experience decline in numbers. Other pastors who served in this church include; Abel Osuma, Charles Oloo, Wycliffe Ganira, Maurice Mukagati, and Zachary Orina.</p>
					<p>It is when Rev. Charles Oloo was leading the church in 1991 that the church moved from YMCA to Lake Primary School. He served in 1995 together with Pastor John Choka. Pastor Choka was a pillar in the church; his exit a short whiles after left the church in disarray. Pastor Choka joined Christco and now pastors the branch in Manyatta. It was at this juncture that pastor Kopella came in to resuscitate the church.</p>
					<p>Rev. Paavo Kopella, a Canadian with a Swedish background, took over the church around 1995. Pastor Paavo invited Pastor Sylus Ochieng who was a student at NPBC to assist him. By this time the membership had dwindled to fifteen (15). Pastor Sylus shuttled between KPC and his base in Kisii. After graduation, in 1997, he settled in Kisumu after his wedding. PAG developed a dislike for Rev. Kopella; he sought ways to ensure the posterity of the church after him. Therefore, he negotiated with PAOC to support the young church obtain a plot in Kisumu. Some of the assembly leaders then were Samuel Nyakundi, Emma Muhindra, and Elinah Siekei among others.</p>
					<h3>THE PAOC FACTOR IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF KPC</h3>
					<p>Pentecostal Assembly of Canada (PAOC) leadership came in around this time led by Gerald Morrison (the then PAOC Director stationed in Nairobi) and Helen McMinn spearheaded the purchase of the land in Robert Ouko estate. This parcel of land was purchased from a Mr. Otieno Othigo who was a counsel of the PAOC. The transaction was concluded with PAOC giving the funds.</p>
					<p>PAOC sought to model the church after the Mombasa Pentecostal Church; this was the notion in Kisumu then. However this changed when Gerald Morrison categorically stated that the land is transferred to CITAM and not PAG who were also interested in the church. As pastor Kopella was leaving, the PAOC leadership visited the church and that Sunday it was pastor Sylus speaking. The leadership thus left him in-charge of KPC.</p>
					<h3>CITAM INVOLVEMENT</h3>
					<p>Christ Is the Answer Ministries came through the involvement of PAOC. CITAM took charge of the assembly officially in 2000. A tent was erected at the Robert Ouko grounds. Pastor Denis White preached as he opened the assembly from the book of Acts 10: 34 – 38; “now I know that God is no respecter of persons.” This opening was followed by a successful one week open air crusade led by Pastor David Muriithi and Pastor Bernard Manyonge at the Church compound. This preceded the tremendous growth of the church under the stewardship of Pastor Martin Mbandu and Sylus Ochieng.</p>
					<p>The growth was a phenomenon that caught the leadership off guard, it was impossible to obtain a chair if you came to church after 10 am for the single service. The church continued to enjoy goodwill until when Pastor Sylus left early 2003. Part of the Advisory committee members also left. This was a very trying time for the church but God has been faithful and thus far, EBENEZER.</p>
					<p>Ruth Otieno, Pst. Ibrahim Ochieng’ Pst. Roslyn Mckenzie, Rev. Gregory Kivanguli, Rev. Elias Mwaura and Rev. Anataka Mugenyi who is currently serving as the Senior Pastor.</p>
					<p>Nb: These memories were compiled and put together by Elders Patrick Ochieng’ (now retired) and Richard Agufana having talked to a number that have been there all this while.</p>
